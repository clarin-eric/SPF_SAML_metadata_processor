Collects, filters, splits/aggregates, SAML metadata about CLARIN SPF SPs across identity federations to assess its
current state. Results are shown by the Centre Registry.

This program is used from the command line. A fork of this codebase is available to the repository owner, with
improvements (large-scale refactoring and systemd integration).

== Requirements
This software was tested with CPython 3.4 only. Most code has been deliberately kept CPython 3.2-compatible because of
past deployment environment limitations.

== To install
Use the standard setuptools installation routine on `setup.py`.

== To run
For instance:
